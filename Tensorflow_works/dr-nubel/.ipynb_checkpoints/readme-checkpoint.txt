Factors that affect shear strength:

the composition of soil minerals,
the initial moisture content,
the degree of saturation,
the over-consolidation ratio,
the initial void ratio,
the porosity,
the loading conditions (drained conditions versus undrained conditions),
the pore fluid composition, weathering,
the number of freeze-thaw cycles the soil is subjected as well as any stabilization techniques used on the clay mass
