Factors that affect shear strength:

the composition of soil minerals,
the initial moisture content,------------------------------Moisture Content
the degree of saturation,----------------------------------Moisture Density
the over-consolidation ratio,
the initial void ratio,
the porosity,
the loading conditions (drained conditions versus undrained conditions),
the pore fluid composition,
weathering,
the number of freeze-thaw cycles the soil is subjected as well as any stabilization techniques used on the clay mass
